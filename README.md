# FighterWebSite

This project is a website that host data tables, displaying MMA fighters stats from multiple organizations. It is using a microsoft access database to hold the data, while being editable in the website. 

To make sure it runs properly add the file in AddToPackages folder to the Packages folder in Folder1. The only reason there are two folders is a size issue when trying to add the project to github. 

There is also a password and username page in the begining of the website. Username is Marko and Password is Test1.
